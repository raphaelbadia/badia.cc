# Catfish - take-home programming test

## Best practices

To ensure global quality on the projet, the following tools are used:

- typescript for type-checking
- commitlint to ensure that commits follow the [conventional commits syntax](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- stylelint, eslint and prettier linting
- husky to run linters before every commit
